          <h2>What is Marketing Automation?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Marketing automation</strong> is the technology that handles repetitive marketing tasks automatically, so you can deliver personalized experiences at scale without burning out your team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of manually sending emails, segmenting lists, and tracking results, marketing automation lets you build workflows once and let them run. A customer abandons their cart? Automation sends the recovery sequence. A lead downloads a whitepaper? Automation nurtures them toward a sale. A customer hasn't purchased in 90 days? Automation re-engages them.
          </p>
          <p>
            With RADICA, you get enterprise-grade marketing automation that's actually easy to use—visual builders, pre-built templates, and AI that optimizes everything from send times to channel selection.
